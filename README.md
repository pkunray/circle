## What is Circle

Circle is a private social network designed with the best elements of popular platforms. Its user interface takes inspiration from Twitter and Threads, while its core idea is borrowed from WeChat Moments. In Circle, you'll experience a clean, ad-free environment with no inappropriate recommendations or interactions with strangers. It's a dedicated space where you and your friends can connect, share, and strengthen your relationships.
